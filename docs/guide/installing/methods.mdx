# Installation

This wouldn't be much of a docuementation of we didn't cover how to properly install TempleOS, the method's and their respective benefits.

Installing TempleOS can be a tedious task to install on [Bare Metal](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/2153/bare-metal) primarily because of the hardware it accepts - or rather doesn't accept. TempleOS wasn't built with large libraries and drivers (considering its size, this is self-explanatory), and as such doesn't work on most hardware. As a result, for this installation we have both methods for Hardware and Virtualized installations.

## **Benefits / Disadvantages**
The Advantages or Disadvantages below are labeled as such based on how the average user would view them, and does not reflect the opinion of TempleOS Simplified.

### Hardware
* Installing on baremetal allows you to use TempleOS as it was intended; a stand-alone operating system. 🔥
* Forcing yourself to use TempleOS, allows you to properly gain an understanding of lower level programming. 🔥
* Limited hardware support as mentioned before. Generally only older PCs are able to run it; like Thinkpads. 🧊
* May be difficult for the average user to install. 🧊
### Virtualized
* Virtualizing any system, generally stops bugs from ending up on your system. 🔥
* Can be installed in only a couple of minutes on any 64-bit PC (Windows/Linux/Mac). 🔥
* Requires an OS to already exist on the PC. 🧊
* Can have a limited feel to it; certain features don't work on certain virtual machines like audio (VirtualBox). 🧊
